# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks
Develop a neural network for MNIST digit recognition, including steps like data download, preprocessing, network setup, feedforward, backpropagation, training, and evaluation. The process involves image normalization, label one-hot encoding, and building a two-layer network for digit classification.
